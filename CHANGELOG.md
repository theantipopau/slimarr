- SABnzbd download queue integration — trigger, monitor, and complete downloads

- Nightly scheduler: library sync at 01:00 UTC, recycling bin cleanup at 03:00 UTC
- Real-time event feed via WebSocket (Socket.IO)

**File management**
- Automatic file relocation after download completes — moves file to Plex library folder, removes old copy
- Plex path mapping — translate Plex-reported paths to locally accessible paths when Slimarr runs on a different machine
- Recycling bin support (optional) — deleted files moved to a holding folder before permanent removal
